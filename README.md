# BattleSnake Admin

This project is for the admin dashboard of the 2018 [battlesnake.io](https://battlesnake.io) coding event.
The actual game server lives at <http://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-server>.

## Getting Started

Pull the repo, then run `./scripts/setup`

### Create some files

Create `./scripts/env-local.yml` and load it with:

```yaml
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: <fill in with your own>

### Run the required services

First, run `./scripts/services` to spin up all the services including the battlesnake game server.

Then, run the migration script for dynamodb `./scripts/migrate`.
